MakeMove(UInt16 move)
=====================

1. get from square
2. get piece at from square using board position array
3. get to-square
4. if capture: calculate capture square (diff from to-square if ep) and get captured piece
5. based on the info above: update moving piece BB + zobrist for moving piece + any captured piece BB + captured piece zobrist + square to Piece array
	(that is the minimum that has to be done in any move)

-- Now check for other things like castling and promo --

6. if promo then remove the moving piece from its BB + update its zobrist + add queen at that location in queen BB + update queen zobrist
7. if castling then get corresponding rook's from- and to- squares (i.e. update its BB) and update its zobrist.
8. update castling + ep + side to move
9. if king in check then restore state

bool IsPseudoLegalMove(UInt16 move)
===================================
check if move is pseudo legal

Board State
===========
1. pieceToBB array
2. squareToPiece array
3. zobrist hash
4. castling and ep rights
5. side to move
