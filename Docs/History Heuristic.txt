History heuristic
-----------------

There are 64 squares a piece can move from, and 64 squares a piece can
move to.  This means we can store a table of  all possible moves (with
many impossible    ones  taking up  useless   space!)  with only 64x64
elements.  This is only 4K of table entries.

So let the move  itself be an index  into this table.  Each element in
the table is a simple counter.  Every time a best move is found at any
level of the search, increment  the counter associated with this move.
Now we have a big table, that given any move we can tell how succesful
it has been as a cutoff (or best move.)

You can use this information to sort the  move list.  Try to sort high
scoring moves (according to the table) close to the front of the list.
Generally, you would still put  captures, killers and hash table moves
up  to  the very front,  but   the rest of   the  moves you could sort
according to this scheme.

If you find the sorting takes too long, don't do it on the last couple
of ply's of the main search.

You may want to have  a separate table  for each color but it probably
isn't   necessary.  One refinement is    to increment the counter more
heavily near the top of the tree.  Your  increment factor could be 2^n
where n could be distance from leaf nodes.
